# Package Information

This package contains a Shiny app that provides the user with weather data from Mars in the past 7 martian (Sol) days.

# main.R

This script transforms the data into an acceptable format from the API

# Shiny app

In order to run the app, the user must use the following code:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("senseiyukisan/732A94-Lab5")

```

The user may then choose to observe the temperature, pressure or windspeed on Mars in the past 7 martian days. The minimum, average and maximum values of those measurements on those days are indicated on the graph.
